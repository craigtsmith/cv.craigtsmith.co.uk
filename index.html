		<p class="attention-grabber">I’m a software engineer and cloud architect from Birmingham, 15 years ago I taught myself how to write HTML & CSS and published my first ever website, since then I haven’t stopped learning new technologies, building things and tinkering with code.</p>
		<p>My career has been varied and extensive, I started of working for a handful of small digital agencies, and quickly progressed to work with Razorfish UK. After Razorfish I took a role at live music startup songkick.com, before moving into freelance consultancy around 2010. </p>
		<p>For the past 7 years I have worked with numerous companies big and small to deliver cloud-based projects on everything from daily-deal sites, online magazines for large publishing houses, investment and banking solutions, finance products and more recently an online video monetization platform.</p>

		<p>Mobicast is a digital video distribution and monetization platform. My role has been to, as part of multi-national, multi-discipline “project team” help build and architect the platform. The role has been very reactive and hands-on covering everything from mobile SDK specification to serverless micro-service design and implementation.</p>
		<p>The platform runs on AWS and is a mix of new and inherited technology spanning a mobile app, web app, video management console, a JavaScript widget library, and various third-party integrations.</p>

		<h5>Technical Lead, Folkefinans, Stockholm / Remote 2013-17</h5>
		<p>Folkefinans is a financial services company in Norway with offices across the Nordics. My role has expanded over 4 years - when I started working with the company there was myself and one other working on the customer facing web-applications.</p>
		<p>The applications interacted with a backend .NET platform that handled CRM, Credit Scoring, KYC and various other business concerns. I’ve been involved in all the major technology decisions since starting including re-platforming the various web-apps, implementing a Mobile App & API and launching a “2nd generation” all new platform on top of AWS.</p>

		<h5>Ruby Developer, songkick.com, London 2009-10</h5>
		<p>Songkick is a live music alert and ticketing platform that includes community features. I joined Songkick’s development team whilst the product was still in private beta and seeking funding. I worked primarily on user-facing feature development as well as bug-fixing and feature planning.</p>
		<p>I pushed for and then ended up heading a team focusing on social features, integrations and viral growth, working with Twitter, Facebook, Spotify and other networks to increase our user-base.</p>

		<h5>Lead Developer: RIA, Razorfish, London 2007-09</h5>
		<p>Razorfish is one of the world’s largest interactive agencies and has been around since the early 90s. I joined their London office as part of their developing Rich Internet Applications team in 2007.</p>
		<p>After a few months at the agency I was fast-tracked to Lead Developer of RIA with a team of 6 developers working alongside me. I helped deliver major projects for international, household names during my time and worked closely with the numerous different departments and disciplines within Razorfish's 250+ strong team.</p>
